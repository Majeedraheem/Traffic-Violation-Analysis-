The goal is to analyze the data to find insights that can help to reduce traffic and managed police resources


## Conclusion:

Data Need more investigation and more future survey,
Most committed Traffic violation was made by males but in percentage terms both male and female committed roughly the same level of violations
Most Traffic violation committed by Black Race,
From the data, we can establish that the police were not overly harsh as a 3rd of all stoppages let to only a warning being issued rather than a citation.

Most violations on Thursday and Friday which might be an indication of work week fatigue kicking in.

Moreover, November and December have most violation presumably because of the holiday session and extra vigilance around this time by the police to discourage drunk driving.

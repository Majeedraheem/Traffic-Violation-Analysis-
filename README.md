From the data we can establish that the police was not overly harsh as a 3rd of all stoppages let to only a warning being issued rather than a citation.

We see most violations on Thursday and Friday which might be an indication of work week fatigue kicking in.


Data regarding race shows that despite popular belief, the police were fair handed with handling violations by people form different race groups.

Roughly the same percentage of people got citations and warnings with no bias.

As expected most violation occur at night time when the roads are relatively empty make drivers careless and drive faster than they normally would
One of most interested facts is all violations committed no one has involved in an accident  !!!!

Data has four years 2012,13,14,15 and 2016 which was the year violation need more investigation specially all others share the same percentage

Moreover, November and December have most violation presumably because of the holiday session and extra vigilance around this time by the police to discourage drunk driving.
